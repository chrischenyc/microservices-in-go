# Building Microservices with Go

I'm follow along Nick Jackson's [Building Microservices with Go](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2V1SxXFUa5YxVJvTsrCgyg) on YouTube. I love his style of teaching by the way.

## Background

I started using Go since Apr 2021, but mostly with AWS and its [Serverless ecosystem](https://serverlessland.com/). I'm using [AWS SDK for Go V2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2) and writing [Lambda in Go](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go) day in, day out.

Come to think of it, my previous project was also a serverless one on AWS, but with Javascript and Node.js. It's been over a year and half since I developed container-based applications last time. And that was a monolith GraphQL server backed by TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes on Amazon EKS.

## Goals

- become more proficient at Go
- refresh Docker skills
- refresh Kubernetes skills
- deep dive in container-based Microservices architecture
- learn gRPC
- try GCP
- learn Nick Jackson's teaching style
